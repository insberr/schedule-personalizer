// Someday we will implement this
// should we run something on a server that checks or
// should we run it on the client and just modify the schedule config on the client ?

// make a web request to the notification thingy
// then check the contents for a message
// check the message
// ...

// we could run a github action on a cron schedule
// we could set up a server
// we could maybe use cloudflare functions?
// or we can do it on the client (actually cant make the web request from the client because cors)
