Pages go here. each gets their own folder, you can seperate a page into multiple parts that way

IE:

```
settings/
    - settings_page.tsx
    - settings_page_tab_general.tsx (you dont have to use these names)
    - settings_page_tab_dev.tsx
```

but something like header.tsx or color_setting.tsx or login_box.tsx would be in components/ and not pages/

also rewrite the router you dumb dumb
