# ics-readme-pls

We could make it so you can import an ics file in the event editor.
also could make it so we just include it in the config files?
Also might be useful to make it so it imports based on a download link, creates events and then updates the events if the calandar file has anything new?

download the ical <https://www.bethelsd.org/site/handlers/icalfeed.ashx?MIID=1>
